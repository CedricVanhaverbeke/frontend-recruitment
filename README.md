Frontend challenge for recruitment purposes. T

## What to test

- useState with function instead of state + 1
- destructure props in component itself
- write a test that fails in the PR
- write a feature that does not work in the PR
- Add a button in a div tag with an onClick method
- Forget a newline in a file
- Forget to use env variables
- Pass functions in onClick that don't need () => {]
- create a switch component
- Pass components as props, test if they suggest to use children
- Check if they know about defaultProps
- Write a test that doesn't do anything true.equals(true)
- Pass an array that makes use of both .map and .filter instead of putting it in one .filter
- forget to add styling for mobile friendly things
- Write pure html instead of jsx, write class instead of className
- forget to wrap an input field in a form
- Add an onclick function on a submit button in a form
- Write a component that basically uses two of the same styled buttons. Test if they see that this should be one component
- Test if they see that { key: key } can be written as {key}
- Test if they know the return value of a useEffect to use as cleanup
- Test if they understand how the dependecy array works of a useEffect hook
- Conditionally render a hook, check if they understand why this is a bad idea.
- Create a function in a parent component, and make it recalculate between renders. Test that they see that we should use the `useCallBack` hook here.
- leave a console.log statement in the code
- Ask some questions, without implementing code itself how a certain feature should be implemented. Ask for pseudocode and give an example.
- Quite hard, write a ref and a useEffect that triggers some code when the ref is found. Check if they know this could be written with the use of a `useCallback` hook.
